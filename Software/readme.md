<p>This program and was developed entirely by yours truly. No packages or assets were imported or referenced. Only a single visual graphic was used (See below)</p>

<h1>Functionality</h1>
<p>This program uses two filterable lists to allow you to track a set of groups/partners, their members, and their resources. 
Both filterable lists can be edited to your liking. New properties can be added and filtered as well. This allows you to keep track of what a partner does, for example. 
Add a property named "Primary Resource" and then assign it a value "Food" and only partners who can provide food (as categorized) will be shown.

Expanding the full details tab can show the exact value of each property that a parter has. This information can be viewed for memmbers in the leftmost column.
